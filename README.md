### Install

If you want to play, just grab [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) (they have a webclient if you don't want to download) and search for the bot in your "search" box (@telemmo_bot).

### Description

TeleMMO is a MMORPG inside a bot made for botting platforms. It's based on Idle games, Ragnarok, Tibia, D&D, and many other games we've played in our lives.

### Bots?

Today we have a telegram bot only, but our code architecture allows for using as many platforms as we want. Since the telegram-only approach allows us to guarantee a player will have only one account per phone number, we'll see how to expand platform range without hurting the game balance.

### Translations

We've added internationalization to the game. If you want to help us translate to another language, we're preparing a Transifex project.

### Bug report

If you found a bug, please open an issue here describing it as much as you can. We hate them as much as you do and we'll try our best to fix it quickly.

### Contribute
